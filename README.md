5. Model Optimization and Tuning Phase
5.1 Tuning Documentation
Hyperparameter Tuning
In the Model Optimization and Tuning phase, hyperparameter tuning plays a
crucial role in enhancing the model's performance and generalization ability.
For our rice grain classification project, we employed a systematic approach
to optimize key hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and
dropout rate.
Methodology:
We employed a combination of manual tuning and automated techniques
such as grid search or random search. Each configuration was evaluated
using a validation set to assess its impact on model performance metrics.
Validation Strategy:
The validation set, partitioned from the training data, was crucial for
evaluating each hyperparameter configuration's effectiveness. We monitored
metrics such as validation accuracy, loss, and convergence behavior across
epochs to make informed decisions.
Impact on Performance:
Hyperparameter tuning significantly improved the model's performance
metrics. For instance, optimizing the learning rate helped stabilize training
and achieve faster convergence, while tuning the dropout rate enhanced the
model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
Regularization Techniques
To enhance the model's robustness and prevent overfitting, we implemented
several regularization techniques throughout the training process.
**Dropout:**
Strategically placed dropout layers within the fully connected layers of the
CNN architecture helped regularize the model by randomly disabling a
fraction of neurons during training. This technique encouraged the network
to learn more robust features and reduce dependency on specific activations,
thereby improving generalization.
Data Augmentation:
During the data preprocessing phase, we applied augmentation techniques
such as rotation, flipping, zooming, and brightness adjustments. These
augmentations increased the diversity of the training dataset, exposing the
model to a wider range of variations in rice grain images. Consequently, the
model became more resilient to minor variations and distortions in input
images during inference.
Batch Normalization:
Incorporating batch normalization layers normalized activations in each
mini-batch during training. This technique accelerated convergence, reduced
internal covariate shift, and improved the overall stability and performance
of the model.

We benchmarked the final model against baseline CNN architectures and
initial configurations. The model showcased enhanced efficiency and
accuracy, underscoring its suitability for real-world deployment in
agricultural applications.

Considering computational resources, including model size and inference
speed, the MobileNetv4 architecture offered a balanced trade-off between
performance and computational efficiency. Its lightweight design and
efficient feature extraction capabilities made it well-suited for deployment
on resource-constrained devices or in edge computing environments.
